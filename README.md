<em>This application enables users to create a professional resume that seamlessly integrates with applicant tracking systems (ATS), eliminating the need for manual data correction and retyping. Users can easily switch between edit and preview modes to visualize the automated formatting of their resume as they write. By clicking the Create Sample button, users can view a completed resume example, and the reset option clears all fields. Once completed, the resume can be downloaded as a PDF.</em>

This application is a part of The Odin Projects Full-Stack Javascript curriculum and was developed with the purpose of learning React and Styled Components. The main challenges I faced were learning how to create class components, works with props and state, and use the styled-components approach to writing css.
